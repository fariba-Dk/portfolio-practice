         Iâ€™m Fariba and my pronouns are she/her. I live in Los Angeles, CA. I am a former business owner and prior to that I was working as a healthcare practitioner as a pharmacist.
Although I always had an interest in the Computer science field, it seemed very intimidating to me, I always thought it's too late for me and I should have pursued it back in college. But as it turned out, the pandemic was a blessing in disguise. It was what made me push things to gear one and pursue my interest in coding! Once, I closed my businesses back in March 2020, I started learning Javascript using all the amazing tools on the internet and my journey started and I was hooked ever since. I love to learn how things work and learn functionality and figure and how to find another way to approach them and fix them once broken. I am a multitasker, hard worker, committed to be teachable, coachable and willing to learn and never stop learning.
I heard about Techtomica in a career training program. It was highly recommended by my career coach but was told I needed to get prepared for it. I respect the culture and the message it advocates to be involved, take lead, help, and fill the gap in the and focus on the very thing that has been inhibiting them from joining the tech world. With Techtonica, I feel at home and love to contribute to the wonderful, selfless, giving community and pay it forward.
